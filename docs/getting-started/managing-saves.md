## Managing Saves

NextUI places all save files by system in `SDCARD_ROOT/Saves`.

### RetroArch .srm Support

By default, NextUI uses the emulator's default save file format.

RetroArch .srm save support can be enabled in Settings.

After making this change any existing save files will have to be renamed.
