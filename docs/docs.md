## About NextUI

NextUI is a custom firmware (CFW) for the TrimUI Brick & Smart Pro retro gaming handhelds.

It was started by [@ro8inmorgan](https://github.com/ro8inmorgan) as a fork of the popular MinUI CFW so they could
implement changes that were determined to be outside the scope of the original project.

NextUI quickly took off and became especially popular on the TrimUI devices.

## Features

NextUI officially supports the TrimUI Brick and TrimUI Smart Pro gaming handhelds.

It features a rebuilt emulation engine and tons of added features outlined below.<br />
<small>Note: For other devices we recommend checking out [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI).</small>

- Fixed both screen tearing and sync stutter problems of MinUI by rebuilding the emulator engine core
- Game switcher menu (Onion OS style) by [@frysee](https://github.com/frysee)
- High quality audio, due to advanced resampling engine
  using [libsamplerate](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsamplerate) (with quality/performance setting per emulator)
- Much lower latency (average 20ms, 1 frame of 60fps)
- Shaders!
- Fully OpenGL/GPU based for faster performance!
- native WiFi support
- Game art/media support
- Game time tracker!
- Cheats support
- Overlays support!
- Broader zip file support (bz2, LZMA)
- Dynamic cpu speed scaling (keeps your device cool and extends battery life, but gives the performance right when
  needed)
- Custom bootlogos contributed by [@SolvalouArt](https://bsky.app/profile/solvalouart.bsky.social)
- Color and font settings to customize the NextUI interface
- Menu animations
- LED control, change colors, effects, brightness

- Display controls (color temperature, brightness, contrast, saturation, exposure)
- Configurable FN/Mute switch that can trigger a "night mode" - toggle between two sets of custom display settings!
- Support for automatic NTP time synchronization with timezones and realtime clock (RTC)
- Deep Sleep mode, gives instant ON and avoids the overheat bug on the Brick
  by [@zhaofengli](https://github.com/zhaofengli)
